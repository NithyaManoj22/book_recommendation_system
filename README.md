# Recommendation-System using the book crossing dataset
Building a Book Recommendation System built using supervised and unsupervised Machine learning techniques. 

## Book-Crossing
The Book-Crossing dataset is a collection of user ratings of books. It comes with both explicit ratings (1-10 stars) and implicit ratings (user interacted with the book).
The data was compiled by Cai-Nicolas Ziegler of IIF and can be found [here](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/).

More information about the data is available in Ziegler et al.:
